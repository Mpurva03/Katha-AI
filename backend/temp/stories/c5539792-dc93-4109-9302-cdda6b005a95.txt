 How far he'll go to protect his family.  Why he feels he must make every step as brave and dangerous as possible.  Is it right to give him a "power" that's not even his own?  And what does the future hold for the man in the jungle, and his family?  Will they be rescued?  Will they die in the process?  Will he be hunted down by the enemies of his family? This is what I hope happens in this book, and I've gotten plenty of feedback that has inspired me to write even more.  And while there are plenty of stories where a character dies, I think I've gotten too much of that to be worth my time for the moment.  I want to put more time into giving these characters their own moments of mystery and excitement.  The "go back and read the book" thing is one I'm sure I'll do again.  I'll also be going back to my library and getting some new books to read.  And if I'm ever in a position where I feel like this story isn't up to par, I'll write it up and post it here.  As far as when I'm going to write the next one, I'm not sure yet.  I'm still in the process of picking up some of the rest of my books, and there are definitely a lot of new ones on the way.
So I'm not sure yet, but it's a start.  I want to write more adventure stories.  I want to write stories that will allow me to take on more adventures, as well as new ones.  I want to write them that will feel fresh and exciting without being dull, and I want to be able to say with confidence that "Oh, I've done that!" when I pick up a new book.  That's why I started with this adventure.  That's what I hope to write more of when I'm done with it.
