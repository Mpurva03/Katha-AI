 This is not about a woman. This is not a story about a man.  This is not a story about a woman with an exotic nature.  This is a tale about the beauty of manhood and the necessity of taking risks.
The man in the jungle.  He will be my friend, and we will work together to achieve our goals.  He is not a monster and he will be no one's enemy.  In fact, he will be one of the most important people in my life.  He has a mission, and I want him to do it.
