Elara, a woodcutter with a beard like tangled roots and eyes the colour of moss after rain, stumbled upon a clearing unlike any he’d seen in his fifty years.  Giant mushrooms, taller than his cottage, sprouted from the emerald floor, their caps glowing with an ethereal, inner light.  A silver stream, singing a melody only the forest could understand, snaked through the heart of the clearing.  But it was the tree that stole his breath.

It was an oak, ancient and immense, its branches reaching towards the heavens like gnarled, supplicating fingers.  Carved into its trunk, in swirling runes of shimmering gold, was a single word:  ‘Aethelred.’  Elara, who knew the old tongues whispered on the wind, understood.  Aethelred, the lost king, imprisoned within the tree by a vengeful sorcerer centuries ago.

A thrill, sharper than any axe, ran down Elara’s spine. Legend spoke of Aethelred’s immense power, a power locked within the oak’s heart, waiting for a worthy soul to release it.  Elara, though a humble woodcutter, felt a surge of courage. He’d always felt a pull towards the unseen, a yearning for something beyond the chopping block and the daily grind.

He circled the tree, his fingers tracing the golden runes.  Suddenly, the ground trembled.  From the depths of the earth, a creature emerged – a Grolak, a beast of shadow and nightmare, its eyes burning like coals.  It snarled, a sound like grinding stones, its claws tearing at the earth.  The Grolak was the sorcerer’s guardian, forever bound to protect the imprisoned king.

Elara, armed only with his axe, knew he couldn’t fight the beast head-on.  He remembered an old wives’ tale – the Grolak feared the song of the silver stream.  He dashed towards the stream, cupped his hands, and sang, his voice a rough but powerful melody, echoing the stream’s song.  The Grolak recoiled, its shadowy form flickering as if threatened by sunlight.

Emboldened, Elara continued his song, weaving into it the ancient runes of the oak, a melody of release and freedom.  As his voice soared, the golden runes glowed brighter, bathing the clearing in a warm, golden light.  The Grolak shrieked, its form dissolving into wisps of shadow, vanishing into the forest's embrace.

The oak creaked, its bark splitting open to reveal a figure draped in shimmering cloth – Aethelred, the lost king.  His eyes, though weary, held the power of centuries. He smiled, a slow, grateful smile.  “Thank you, Elara,” he said, his voice echoing with the weight of time. “For freeing me from my prison.”

Aethelred, true to the legends, gifted Elara not with gold or jewels, but with the gift of foresight, the ability to see the future in the patterns of the forest. Elara returned to his cottage, no longer a simple woodcutter, but a man touched by magic, forever bound to the whispering secrets of the woods.  He still chopped wood, but now, he did so with a knowing smile, seeing the future unfold in the grain of each felled tree.
