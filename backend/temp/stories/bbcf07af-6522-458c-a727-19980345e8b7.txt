The crow perched on a gnarled branch, its obsidian eyes fixed on me.  It wasn’t the bird itself that chilled me, but the unsettling stillness of the Blackwood Forest, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the villagers.  I'd come seeking the lost mine of Blackwood, lured by tales of unimaginable riches guarded by ancient evils.  This crow, however, felt like a harbinger.

Its caw, when it finally came, was not the usual raucous sound. It was a low, guttural croak, a sound that vibrated in my chest, resonating with the oppressive silence of the woods.  Following its gaze, I saw a faint path, barely visible beneath the thick undergrowth, disappearing into the heart of the forest's darkness.  

Hesitation gnawed at me.  My compass spun wildly, its needle thrashing like a trapped animal.  But the lure of gold, the whisper of untold wealth, pushed me forward.  I followed the path, the crow’s shadow flitting ahead like a malevolent guide.

The air grew heavy, thick with the smell of damp earth and something else… something acrid and sickeningly sweet.  Twisted trees clawed at the sky, their branches gnarled and skeletal, like the fingers of the dead reaching out.  The sunlight struggled to pierce the dense canopy, casting long, dancing shadows that writhed and pulsed with an unnatural life.

Then I saw them.  Not the gold, not yet.  But carvings.  Crude, unsettling carvings etched into the ancient trees – grotesque faces with vacant eyes and gaping maws, their forms twisting and writhing in a silent scream.  Each carving seemed to pulse faintly, as if alive.

The crow landed on a particularly grotesque carving, its black feathers ruffled.  It tilted its head, as if watching my reaction, a chilling intelligence glinting in its eyes.  Then, it let out another croak, this time closer to a shriek, and took flight, disappearing into the deepening gloom.

The path ended at a gaping maw in the earth, a cave swallowed by shadow.  The air from within was frigid, carrying the stench of decay and something else, something ancient and unholy.  Fear, cold and sharp, pierced my resolve.  But the lure of the mine, the promise of untold riches, was a siren song I couldn't resist.

I descended into the darkness, my lantern casting a feeble circle of light that was swallowed by the suffocating blackness beyond.  The air grew colder, the silence deeper.  The only sound was the drip, drip, drip of water echoing in the vast cavern.

Then I heard it.  A low, guttural chanting, rising and falling in rhythm with the drip of water.  The chanting grew louder, closer.  I turned my lantern towards the source of the sound, and my blood ran cold.

Silhouetted against the dim light were figures, hunched and skeletal, their eyes burning with an unnatural fire.  They were not human.  They were something ancient, something from the shadows of the earth, something that had been awakened by my intrusion.  The crow's warning had been clear, but I had ignored it.  Now, surrounded by the horrors of the Blackwood mine, I knew I was trapped, a sacrifice to the ancient evil that guarded its riches. The gold, I realized, was the least of my worries. My survival was the only treasure I now sought, a treasure I doubted I would find.
