Not to be confused with the crows of the same name found in fairy tales, which can be found in the eastern part of the world.
3) In the end, the bird will fly away.  I have not heard of a real story where the crow is captured, but it is always possible, especially if the story is based on a real animal.  It is very common for the crow to be captured when it is in danger from a predator, but it is not always that way.
4) The crow is a very active bird and can be quite aggressive.  There are some reports of the crow killing birds, but it is rarely a serious issue, and it is usually just an accident.
5) The crow is also known as the "crow owl".  There are several different species of crow in the northern part of the world, but they are not necessarily related to each other.  There is a crow owl, a raven, and a crow with a large black patch on its head.  Crows with black patches on their heads are also called crows.
6) Although crow is a common bird in the northern part of the world, its range has shrunk a lot since the days of the European explorers.  Crows have been hunted as pets and as an ornamental item since the early 1900s, but now most of their range has been lost, and they are only found in parts of Asia and Africa.  Crows have also been observed in the United States, but it is not clear whether they are threatened or not.
7) Although some people believe that ravens are related to crows, they are not exactly related.  There are many birds that are more closely related to ravens, such as the crow.  Crows are one of the few birds that do not have any sense of smell.  Crows have a very unique voice, which is heard on all parts of their body, from their throats to their wings.  When they speak, they make a complex series of sounds, called roars.
8) The crow is a very adaptable bird, and will change its diet for different situations, depending on its needs and the environment it is in.  It will eat mainly insects and spiders, including the small insects that have been identified as being the keystone species of the crow.  It will also eat insects, plants, and birds that have no special taste
