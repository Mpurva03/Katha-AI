It's a beautiful story about how a crow is drawn to a tree and falls into a forest.  You can't tell me this wasn't a book!  It's wonderful.
I will say, though, that this story is a little too close to what the first book, I think, was about.  I was hoping for more, and I'm not sure there was a better choice.  I also wanted to mention that this story is written in English.  I read it in Spanish.  I don't think I can tell you what else it's about, but you can read it in your native language.
Now, this first story is about what happens when the crow falls into the forest.  There is a scene where the crow is standing over a tree and watching a squirrel.  The squirrel is holding its tail, which looks like it's holding its tail very close to the ground.  Crow doesn't seem to be listening very well, but I think it's not because of the squirrel, but rather because he's trying to understand the squirrel.  Crow doesn't seem to understand squirrel, but instead he's looking at the squirrel.  The squirrel isn't listening, so he thinks the crow is looking at him.
That's when the crow gets confused.  The squirrel is holding its tail in a very awkward position, and he's trying to think of something to do with it.  Crow is trying to think about things.  The squirrel is saying to him "I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not going to understand what I'm saying.  What's your name?"  So then the squirrel says to crow "I'm Crowslips.  I'm a squirrel." and the crow says "You're Crowslips."  The squirrel says "You're wrong." and then says "Well, I'm not going to be called by that anymore."  That's when the squirrel says "I think you're going to be called something different.  I think you're going to be called a crow."  Crow is thinking "What?"  The squirrel says "I think I'm going to be called a crow." and then "You're right."  Crow says "What's wrong with you?" and then he's saying "Well, you're not going to be called a crow anymore
