The brackish water of the Blackwood Mire stank of decay and secrets.  I, Corvus, was no stranger to secrets. I’d seen things in my long, black life – things that clung to the shadows like the clinging mist that hung heavy over the mire.  But this… this was different.

It started with the whispers. The reeds whispered it, the wind carried it, the very mud seemed to groan it:  *Corvus… the water… needs…*

Curiosity, that ravenous beast that gnaws at even the oldest crow, drove me closer. The mire stretched before me, a vast, oily expanse reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Usually, I avoided such places.  But the whispers were insistent, a chilling lullaby promising something… forbidden.

Then I saw it.

A crow, larger than any I'd ever encountered, submerged in the mire. Not merely floating, but *submerged*, its ebony feathers plastered to its body, its wicked eyes just barely visible beneath the murky surface.  It was impossibly still, a dark, feathered monolith in the heart of the swamp.

Fear, a sensation I hadn’t felt in decades, clawed at my throat.  But the whispers intensified, a chorus now, beckoning me closer, promising answers, promising… power.

I landed on a gnarled cypress knee, its wood slick with the mire’s foul ichor.  Hesitantly, I dipped a claw into the water. It was icy, and something slithered against my talons – a long, pale thing, like a decaying root, but with a disconcerting, almost rhythmic pulse.

The submerged crow shifted.  A ripple spread across the water, widening, growing, until the surface seemed to breathe.  The whispers intensified into a guttural croak, a sound that echoed not just in my ears, but in the very marrow of my bones.

I felt a pull, a powerful, irresistible urge to join the submerged crow, to sink into the mire's embrace.  My wings beat, but I couldn't flee.  The mire was a living thing, a sentient swamp, and it was claiming me.

Then, from the depths, a hand emerged. Not a bird's claw, but a hand.  Pale, skeletal, with long, black fingernails that dripped with the mire's viscous fluid.  It reached for me, beckoning me down to join the submerged crow, to become one with the horrifying secrets of the Blackwood Mire.

I fought with a strength I didn't know I possessed.  I beat my wings with frantic desperation, clawing at the cypress knee, tearing at the wood with my beak.  Finally, with a desperate lunge, I broke free, leaving behind a single, black feather drifting on the surface of the mire.

I flew, fleeing the whispers, fleeing the pull, fleeing the horrifying vision of a submerged crow and a hand reaching from the depths.  I never looked back.  But even now, years later, the whispers still linger in the wind, a chilling reminder of the Blackwood Mire and the power it holds beneath its foul, murky surface.  And sometimes, when the wind howls just right, I swear I hear the submerged crow’s croak.
