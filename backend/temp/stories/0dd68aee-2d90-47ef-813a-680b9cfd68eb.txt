This isn't a story about some "crazed person" going crazy.  This is a story about some crow and a pot of water.  A crow who has been fed a poisoned pot of water for three days has developed the mental capacity to communicate.  He's also quite a bit smarter than the average person.  If you've ever tried to talk to a person who just wants to drink water, then you've probably experienced the same thing.  So, if you're going to try to talk to a person who just wants to drink water, don't assume that if you can't explain to them what happened that they're crazy.  You'll probably just end up as a zombie who can't communicate. I have no idea how to start a story that starts with a crow and a pot of water.  I'm willing to bet that I could find a writer with a pretty good idea of how to do that, though.  If you're just going to start with a crow, you can't start with a pot of water either, and that's fine.  You're free to start with anything.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.  You're free to start with a crow or a pot of water.
